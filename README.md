To access and run the portfolio code you shared, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create the HTML File
1. **Open a text editor** like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++.
2. **Create a new file** and save it as `portfolio.html`.
3. **Copy and paste** the HTML code you provided into this file.

### Step 2: Organize Files and Assets
- In case you have any additional images or external assets you want to include (e.g., background images), **save them in the same folder** where you save your HTML file. For now, your HTML file references no images or external files except for URLs.

### Step 3: Open the HTML File in a Browser
1. **Navigate to the folder** where you saved your `portfolio.html` file.
2. **Double-click the `portfolio.html` file**, and it will automatically open in your default web browser.

### Step 4: Modify and Test the Portfolio
1. **Test the links** such as your LinkedIn and Instagram to ensure they are correct.
2. **Check the table, skills section, projects, and references** for any updates you may want to make, such as adding more information or updating the design.

### Step 5: Make Edits and Improvements (Optional)
- If you need to make changes or improvements (such as adding additional sections, adjusting the styles, or fixing typos), open the `portfolio.html` file in your text editor, make the edits, and then refresh the page in your browser to see the changes.
  
### Folder Structure
Your folder should look like this:

```
/portfolio
    └── portfolio.html
```

Now, your portfolio webpage will be accessible, and you can share it with others by either hosting it online (using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any other hosting service) or sharing the HTML file directly.
